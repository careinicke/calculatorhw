    <h1>The cost of JUULing</h1>
    <h2>The nicotine delivery system is a safer and cheaper alternative to smoking cigarettes. But that doesn't mean that everyone should start Juuling.</h2>

<p>Every day, Stephan Montes, 22, pulls his Juul out of his pocket and starts puffing. The tiny, usb-shaped e-cigarette is so unnoticeable that sometimes, he doesn't even wait until he's in a designated smoking space on Columbia's campus, where he is a senior, to start using it. Unlike a cigarette, the Juul produces no smoke, just water vapor, and, depending on the flavor of pod selected, a pleasant smell. </p>

<p>Like many users, Montes started Juuling because he was smoking all the time and heard that it was a safer alternative that cost less money. The Juul e-cigarette has become popular with smokers of all ages, but especially with young adults and teens because of its sleek looks, ease of use and many-flavored pods. </p>

<p>This has made the Juul controversial in the United States. Users love it, but the company has had to push back against claims that it actively markets to teens. Anti-smoking groups are unhappy that it claims to be healthier than smoking cigarettes, and want it to have a penalty tax like other nicotine products. Few are painting a comprehensive picture weighing the pros and the cons of Juul use. </p>

<p>While there are some clear benefits to Juuling over other tobacco use, it is important to weigh them against the negatives as well.</p>

<p>There is "no doubt that they are less harmful than cigarettes," said Lynn Kozlowski, a professor of community and health at the University at Buffalo and a smoking, nicotine and tobacco policy expert.</p>

<p>Juuls are a much simpler product than cigarettes. They don't have many of the carcinogens found in cigarettes, and because they don't need to be lit with a match or lighter, take out the combustion of materials that produces harmful smoke. </p> 

<p>Instead, a Juul user inhales nicotine vapor, which gives the same feeling as smoking a cigarette. 
Removed from many of the carcinogens in cigarettes, using nicotine alone is not especially damaging physiologically for most otherwise healthy adults. </p>

<p>But e-cigarettes are not without risk. Studies have shown that other chemicals like lead are inhaled in nicotine vapor, and some may be carcinogenic. Even if nicotine were isolated, it is itself a highly addictive substance. </p>

<p>I'm "concerned that teenagers are using a lot of these vape devices and becoming addicted to nicotine," said Dr. Norman H. Edelman, M.D. and Senior Scientific Adviser of the American Lung Association. He added that when teens become addicted to nicotine, there is a chance that they will move from Juuling to smoking cigarettes, which is very detrimental to health. </p>

<p>There is some debate that that opposite is true, that e-cigarettes like the Juul provide a better alternative to smokers. But it does not seem to help them quit. </p>

<p>Emma Shaw, 23, has been able to trade her daily cigarette habit to a daily Juul one. </p>

<p>"I smoked cigarettes and weed before and now I do not smoke cigarettes anymore," Shaw said. She prefers Juuling and has no intention of going back to cigarettes. </p>

<p> Dr. Edelman said that this is part of the problem.</p>

<p>"People that are promoting this as safer are reducing the determination of people to quit smoking," he said, adding that the Juul is not an FDA approved device for smoking cessation.  </p>

<p>That's why the American Lung Association is still firm in its stance against all products that contain tobacco and nicotine, regardless of delivery method. </p>

<p>Other experts disagree with this approach.</p>

<p>"There will be a bunch of kids that experiment with a range of things that we would prefer they not do," said Kozlowski. He thinks it's better to give factual information about products to consumers that clearly state the risks of using each product. </p>

<p>"For some kids, the best we may be able to do is to hope they use an e-cigarette or smokeless tobacco, which is much less dangerous than cigarettes," Kozlowski said. "The risk of all these products is not equivalent."
 </p>

 <p> For Juulers like Shaw and Montes, safer is a step in the right direction. Even if they aren't kicking their nicotine habits to the curb now, they're glad to be saving some money - the Juul is less expensive than cigarettes across the board. </p>

 <p>And the growing popularity of the Juul has some perks. Montes said he "buys his pods at a bodega near school," the same place where he used to buy packs of cigarettes. </p>
